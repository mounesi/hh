            "Just returned from a - night stay at the Park Central. We were a little concerned after reading the reviews about the hotel but can honestly say that this hotel was fine. It is in a great location, within walking distance to Central Park and Times Square, and the bus stops right outside the hotel. The decor was a bit dull but bedding and bathroom was very clean. The staff also seemed very friendly and helpful. The cost of this hotel was very reasonable, and for the price we couldn't have really asked for more. Would definately recommend this hotel for its location and would not worry about saying there again.\n",

            "The best thing about this hotel is the location. Everything you could possibly need is within walking distance. It is a prime location for this very busy area of New York. The Tick Tock Diner is also attached to this hotel - great place to eat any time of the day.\r\n",
            "Overall, I was somewhat upset with our decision to stay here. I just don't feel like I got my money's worth. Don't get me wrong - it is a very historic hotel and they have done a decent job updating everything. We had a great view of the Hudson and the location was wonderful, but I just felt like it should have been 'nicer' for the price.

            "My husband and two of our friends chose this hotel based on its prime location and positive reviews on trip advisor. However, the only good thing about this hotel was its location. We arrived on a Saturday morning shortly before noon. Unfortunately, we weren't able to check-in early, which was ok, so we went to have some lunch. We came back after a few hours, so only about - hours before their normal check-in time, and asked what the status of our room was. While the gentleman at the front desk was checking, the other woman at the front desk overheard our last name, typed it in the computer and says \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"Nope! Not ready.\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" Didn't even give the man we were working with a chance to complete his research and see if there was something he could do for us. So, we went walking around and called to check in, about -- minutes prior to check in time. The woman who rudely interrupted us before, answered the phone. I told her we were calling to check on the status of our room, and she said \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"is your last name [spells out last name]?\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" I said it was, and without even checking, she responds with \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"it's not ready.\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" I asked her if she checked the computer, to which she replied \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"no\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" and hung up. Wow, so nice of you. I then called back to speak with the manager and informed her of the rude front desk staff, and she said she would put a rush on our room and call us when it was ready. Did we ever receive a call? Nope. Finally, we came back right at check-in time and the room was ready. The doormen, like another reviewer mentioned, don't help at all (never once opened a door for us or offered to help with luggage during our stay), and we were never able to use the elevator since it took forever to arrive each time we tried. Then, comes the WORST part of our stay. Late Sunday afternoon, we receive a paper that was slipped under our door informing us that the City of NY was going to be shutting off our water the next day from -:----:--. Not even one day notice! So, we go to speak with the manager at the front desk and ask him to work with us. I explained this was the last day of our vacation, and now - of us would each have to wake up earlier than desired to make sure we could take a shower. I asked if he would appreciate having to wake up early on his vacation...his response \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"I have kids, so I'm always up early.\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" Not what you want to hear from management...whatever happened to customer service. I asked if they had advance notice of the water being shut off. He said they did, but didn't know the timeframe. Well, had they informed us that the water would be turned off, for any period of time, during our stay, we wouldn't have chosen that hotel...how convenient that they didn't inform their guests until a few hours before the water was to be shut off???!! So, I asked him what we were supposed to do if we needed to use the restroom while the water was turned off. He said \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"fill your tub up with water and use the water from there.\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" WOW...I just paid $---+ to stay at this hotel, and now I have to fill my tub up with water in order to be able to go to the bathroom? The customer service here just absolutely blew my mind. I have always loved NY and enjoyed taking trips here, but the service we received at this hotel, was just horrible. I would never come back or recommend that anybody stay here.\n",
            "The hotel is in a great location, and somewhat what you would expect from a hilton in terms of what it has to offer - however i had a horrible experience staying here this past weekend. \r\n",
            "I am a few weeks away from giving birth and things got off to the wrong foot when i called to request a King room before checking in, was told that was fine, upon checking in I was told that a king would not be available since most of the hotel rooms are doubles. I went up to the room - and then the keys did not work (had to then go all the way back down to get the keys activated). The room was ok - but not as clean as I would expect from a Hilton or another hotel in this range - hair around the tub , in the corners and dust all over the bathroom.\r\n",
            "On my first morning there i had the security lock on the door - thankfully because the housekeeper did not bother to knock prior to just opening the door! when she slammed the door into the security lock she just closed it again ... no apology, nothing.\r\n",
            "I never did get my room cleaned that day. The next day I called housekeeping as I was leaving to ask for housekeeping, although they replaced the towels, the sheets were not changed, and the bathroom was not cleaned.\r\n",
            "I had to extend my stay by - night, knowing that the hotel may not figure this out I asked at the front desk if I could just keep my existing room - to avoid moving for the additional night. I was told that was fine - no mention of having to do anything else! When I called to confirm this again in the morning I was told I would have to go downstairs and have my keys replaced (why they didnt do this the day before or tell me this previously i dont know! - when i went down I was asked \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"Do you want a king room ! because you were booked for one!\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" \r\n",

            "What was the worst is that instead of considering that a Hilton employee could have give us a late check out and forgotten to put it into the computer system - the front desk staff just assumed we were lying . \r\n",
            "There are many great hotels , within the same location and price range in the area - I will not be staying at this hotel (and will probably avoid hiltons in general after this stay - i have never been treated this poorly as a guest at other chains (Starwood or Kimpton for me!)\n",
            "I booked two rooms at this hotel for my friend's --th birthday. It was supposed to be a nice getaway for four girlfriends to celebrate a special birthday. We checked in to our rooms around -:-- p.m. with plans to get ready for a special evening out. We had dinner reservations at - p.m. When we arrived in our rooms we found that the hotel had given us the wrong rooms. We had reserved two rooms with two queen beds in each. Instead our rooms each had one king. We called the front desk to let them know of the mistake and they said there were no other rooms available and there was nothing else they could do. We insisted that they find an alternative for us. The man at the front desk told me he was the manager and asked me to give him - minutes and he said he would call back. He did not call back for -- min. I finally called him back. At that point he said again there was nothing he could do. Again - we insisted that he make some sort of adjustment for the mistake. He said he was busy and could I call back later??? To make a long story short - he eventually offered us two suites that still each only had king beds. We decided to take the option even though what we really wanted was the two beds in each room which we had reserved. We moved all of our luggage up to the --th floor with no offer of help from the front desk. Upon arriving in our new rooms, we discovered that one of the suites only had a full-sized bed not a king or even a queen. So now we were worse off than before. We called the front desk and explained the situation and asked to go back to our old rooms where at least if we had to share beds, they were king size beds...and not full-sized. We were told that those rooms were no longer available. At this point, we were already late for our dinner reservation and had not had time to shower and change as we had planned. We complained to the guy who originally said he was the manager.\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" He had the real manager call us back and this guy was no better. Instead of being apologetic and polite, he was very curt and not apologetic in the least. He asked us to explain the situation once again and had to nerve to admonish us for speaking quickly on the phone as we were rushing to try to make our dinner reservation. When I explained that the situation was making us late for dinner, the manager said I don't see how this bedding issue has anything to do with your lack of preparedness time!!!! Again I explained that we had been moving between rooms and have been on the phone with his staff for the past hour. At this point, we were about to loose our dinner reservation. We were already quite late. The hotel was quickly ruining a --th birthday celebration for four moms who rarely have the opportunity to get away for an evening. Ultimately, the manager came up with another room that had a king bed so we had to move rooms yet another time. When it was all said and done - we were in FIVE different rooms. The hotel never apologized. The manager was very snooty and rude. To make matters worse, they charged my credit card with an additional $--- to cover any expenses that might have been incurred???? I called to question this and the hotel said they standardly run a $--- charge on a guest's card to cover any additional costs and that they then refund the charge if not used. In my case, they charged $--- X - -- four times for a total of $---.\r\n",
            "This did not need to be a disastrous stay. All it would have taken would have been a little competency from the guy at the front desk who claimed to be the manager and some level of customer service from the real manager who had quite an attitude. \r\n",

They also offered me another room, but I did not take it.\r\n",
            "My room was just a few inches bigger the the queen size bed and there was no closet in the room. Not even a hook or any clothes hangers.

I immediately pulled back the covers all the way to the foot of the bed & searched for bed bugs or anything else. Everything was clean. So, I was ok with the room. The A-C temp was set at -- degrees, so I turned it down to --...(we like our room COLD) and checked out the rest of the room.... the bathroom was spacious & clean...no mold.

But, I know they were clean.... at least they LOOKED clean. Anyway, we had to kick off the sheet to feel comfortable in the room.

I switched rooms two times before I finally got into a room that was sufficient. The first room was right above construction that is going on and decided to move because of the noise. The second room was so small with the king sized bed that I couldn't even fit my suitcase in there without having to step over it. The third room was supposed to be a \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"superior room\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" like the one I got last time. However, the room wasn't much bigger than the other two that I was moved from. After all that was said and done I decided to have a look at the bathroom. As you can see in the pictures that go along with this review the shower was probably the DIRTIEST hotel shower I have ever had. The grout was a yellow color and the shower floor was a dingy dark color as if it had never been scrubbed before. Also, the -th floor; which this room was located had the WORST smell once you stepped off the elevator and got to the room. It smelt like constantly like Curry which isn't the most pleasant smell to smell after eating dinner or in the morning. Because of this, I will probably never stay here again. I would advise you to try and find somewhere else to stay.\n",

The hotel tried to downplay the parking when we asked. The second issue is that we left our room for the wedding and we left money on the dresser because we were rushing. The money was left inside of a cigarette box . When we returned to our room and open the box.. the money was gone. We noticed that when we left the towels had been changed and the beds had been made. We contact the hotel manager who first suggest that the money would not have come up missing if we had put up a don't disturb sign.
